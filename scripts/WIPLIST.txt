Plans

Weapons- 5 planned, maybe more
=======================================================================================================
Pistol (blaster)
A fast firing laser autopistol desinged for close-medium range.

SPECIAL: Overclock- A cooldown-based ability that temporarily increases your damage, speed, jump power,
and reload speed. Runs on a cooldown that must recharge for the special to be used again.

PLANNED-
-an actual laser beam that you can see shoot instead of magical spawning bullets
-RECOIL AND SPREAD.
-balance overdrive. increases bullet spread in exchange for damage and power
- replace model with something that doesn't look like a nerf gun
=======================================================================================================
Shotgun
A double barrel shotgun designed for crowd control. Effective at close range only.

SPECIAL: Dragon's Breath- Another cooldown based ability that when used, loads two special shells that set
everything in front of you on fire. Fairly long cooldown in exchange for the ability to clear large groups.

PLANNED-
- Finish it
- Bullet spread
- Decide on either a cooldown special or a limited ammo that certain enemies drop.
- probably replace model
=======================================================================================================
Black Hole Launcher (BFG)
Makes a huge black hole that pulls in everything nearby and does lots of damage. Very limited ammo.

SPECIAL: why would I even need this. It shoots black holes

PLANNED-
- Make it
- Figure out how to make artifical gravity
- decide on wether ammo should even be obtainable or if the gun should be a limited use heavy weapon
=======================================================================================================
Sniper Rifle
Slow firing bolt-action rifle that is best at long range.

SPECIAL: Time Dilation- slows time when a certain key is pressed, allows for easier sniping as well as
making no-scopes a mechanic

PLANNED-
- make it
- find model
- seperate reloading into two animation tracks for cycling bolt and reloading
